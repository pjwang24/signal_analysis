# Signal Analysis

### README: Sinusoidal Functions and Fourier Series Visualization

#### Project Overview
This project is a Python-based visualization of sinusoidal functions, focusing on the fundamental frequency of an A string (110 Hz) and its corresponding harmonics. The project illustrates the combination of these harmonic signals, providing insights into how the superposition of different frequency components forms complex waveforms, similar to those encountered in acoustics, signal processing, and Fourier series analysis.

#### Files
- **main.py**: This file contains the code to generate and plot the combined time-domain signal of the fundamental frequency and its second, third, and fourth harmonics.

#### Key Concepts
- **Fundamental Frequency**: The basic frequency of the A string (110 Hz).
- **Harmonics**: Multiples of the fundamental frequency. The second harmonic is twice the fundamental (233.35 Hz), the third harmonic is thrice the fundamental (350.02 Hz), and the fourth harmonic is four times the fundamental (466.7 Hz).
- **Sinusoidal Signals**: Each harmonic is represented as a sinusoidal wave, and the combined signal is the sum of these individual waves.
- **Fourier Series**: The project demonstrates a Fourier series concept, where complex signals are decomposed into simpler sinusoidal components.
